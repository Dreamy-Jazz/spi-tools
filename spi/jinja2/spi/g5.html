  <h1><small>G5 analysis for User:{{ case_name }}</small></h1>
  <p>The following edits are possible G5 candidates.  They are pages
    which were created by socks (or suspected socks) while the master
    was blocked.  There's also a score, based on some vague heuristics,
    indicating how likely it is that each page is G5 eligible.</p>
  <p>Note: Everything here is just hints and guidance.  You are
    soley reponsible for determining if each page meets all the G5
    criteria and what to do about it.</p>
